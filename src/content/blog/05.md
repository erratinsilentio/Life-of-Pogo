Dear readers, welcome to the uproarious journey that has been my first year in Warsaw. From the moment I entered this feline-friendly city, every day has been a whirlwind of adventures, transforming me from a tiny ball of fur to the mischievous Bengal cat that graces these pages.

My escapades include unraveling Warsaw's yarn reserves, turning quiet corners into racetracks for midnight zoomies, and engaging in playful whisker wars with my elder companion, Pidgie. The kitchen has witnessed my daring missions for fishy treasures, leaving behind a trail of crinkled wrappers and a proud, fish-scented Bengal.

Amidst it all, the window by which I sit becomes a perch for observing Warsaw's avian residents, a vigilant lookout point for a curious kitten growing into a seasoned cat.

Join me in "From Kitten to Cat," a tale of growth, mischief, and the paw-licking triumphs that have shaped me in this extraordinary city.
